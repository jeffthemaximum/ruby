# data structures

### BST

- From here: https://gist.github.com/jonaphin/2645532

- This codez uses `Struct`s, which are written about here: https://www.leighhalliday.com/ruby-struct

- `Struct`'s are basically simple classes without an `initialize` method or any other methods.

- see `demo.rb` for an example of a BST.
